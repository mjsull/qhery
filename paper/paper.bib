	abstract = {As novel {SARS}-{CoV}-2 variants with different patterns of spike protein mutations have emerged, the susceptibility of these variants to neutralization by antibodies has been rapidly assessed. However, neutralization data are generated using different approaches and are scattered across different publications making it difficult for these data to be located and synthesized. The Stanford Coronavirus Resistance Database ({CoV}-{RDB}; https://covdb.stanford.edu) is designed to house comprehensively curated published data on the neutralizing susceptibility of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 variants and spike mutations to monoclonal antibodies ({mAbs}), convalescent plasma ({CP}), and vaccinee plasma ({VP}). As of December 31, 2021, {CoV}-{RDB} encompassed 257 publications including 91 (35\%) containing 9,070 neutralizing {mAb} susceptibility results, 131 (51\%) containing 16,773 neutralizing {CP} susceptibility results, and 178 (69\%) containing 33,540 neutralizing {VP} results. The database also records which spike mutations are selected during in vitro passage of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 in the presence of {mAbs} and which emerge in persons receiving {mAbs} as treatment. The {CoV}-{RDB} interface interactively displays neutralizing susceptibility data at different levels of granularity by filtering and/or aggregating query results according to one or more experimental conditions. The {CoV}-{RDB} website provides a companion sequence analysis program that outputs information about mutations present in a submitted sequence and that also assists users in determining the appropriate mutation-detection thresholds for identifying non-consensus amino acids. The most recent data underlying the {CoV}-{RDB} can be downloaded in its entirety from a {GitHub} repository in a documented machine-readable format.},

	abstract = {Summary The {SARS}-{CoV}-2 3CL protease (3CLpro) is an attractive therapeutic target, as it is essential to the virus and highly conserved among coronaviruses. However, our current understanding of its tolerance to mutations is limited. Here, we develop a yeast-based deep mutational scanning approach to systematically profile the activity of all possible single mutants of the 3CLpro and validate a subset of our results within authentic viruses. We reveal that the 3CLpro is highly malleable and is capable of tolerating mutations throughout the protein. Yet, we also identify specific residues that appear immutable, suggesting that these may be targets for future 3CLpro inhibitors. Finally, we utilize our screening as a basis to identify E166V as a resistance-conferring mutation against the clinically used 3CLpro inhibitor, nirmatrelvir. Collectively, the functional map presented herein may serve as a guide to better understand the biological properties of the 3CLpro and for drug development against coronaviruses.},

While the high-coverage afforded can be used, in principle, to identify very rare variants in a population, existing ad hoc approaches frequently fail to distinguish true variants from sequencing errors. We report a method ({LoFreq}) that models sequencing run-specific error rates to accurately call variants occurring in \&lt;0.05\% of a population. Using simulated and real datasets (viral, bacterial and human), we show that {LoFreq} has near-perfect specificity, with significantly improved sensitivity compared with existing methods and can efficiently analyze deep Illumina sequencing datasets without resorting to approximations or heuristics. We also present experimental validation for {LoFreq} on two different platforms (Fluidigm and Sequenom) and its application to call rare somatic variants from exome sequencing datasets for gastric cancer.

However, current predictors analyze variants as isolated events, which can lead to incorrect predictions when adjacent variants alter the same codon, or when a frame-shifting indel is followed by a frame-restoring indel. Exploiting known haplotype information when making consequence predictions can resolve these issues.{BCFtools}/csq is a fast program for haplotype-aware consequence calling which can take into account known phase. Consequence predictions are changed for 501 of 5019 compound variants found in the 81.7M variants in the 1000 Genomes Project data, with an average of 139 compound variants per haplotype. Predictions match existing tools when run in localized mode, but the program is an order of magnitude faster and requires an order of magnitude less memory.The program is freely available for commercial and non-commercial use in the {BCFtools} package which is available for download from http://samtools.github.io/bcftools.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {Monoclonal antibodies ({mAbs}) offer a treatment option for individuals with severe {COVID}-19 and are especially important in high-risk individuals where vaccination is not an option. Given the importance of understanding the evolution of resistance to {mAbs} by {SARS}-{CoV}-2, we reviewed the available in vitro neutralization data for {mAbs} against live variants and viral constructs containing spike mutations of interest. Unfortunately, evasion of {mAb}-induced protection is being reported with new {SARS}-{CoV}-2 variants. The magnitude of neutralization reduction varied greatly among {mAb}–variant pairs. For example, sotrovimab retained its neutralization capacity against Omicron {BA}.1 but showed reduced efficacy against {BA}.2, {BA}.4 and {BA}.5, and {BA}.2.12.1. At present, only bebtelovimab has been reported to retain its efficacy against all {SARS}-{CoV}-2 variants considered here. Resistance to {mAb} neutralization was dominated by the action of epitope single amino acid substitutions in the spike protein. Although not all observed epitope mutations result in increased {mAb} evasion, amino acid substitutions at non-epitope positions and combinations of mutations also contribute to evasion of neutralization. This Review highlights the implications for the rational design of viral genomic surveillance and factors to consider for the development of novel {mAb} therapies.},

	abstract = {Nirmatrelvir, an oral antiviral targeting the 3CL protease of {SARS}-{CoV}-2, has been demonstrated to be clinically useful against {COVID}-19 (refs. 1,2). However, because {SARS}-{CoV}-2 has evolved to become resistant to other therapeutic modalities3–9, there is a concern that the same could occur for nirmatrelvir. Here we examined this possibility by in vitro passaging of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 in nirmatrelvir using two independent approaches, including one on a large scale. Indeed, highly resistant viruses emerged from both and their sequences showed a multitude of 3CL protease mutations. In the experiment peformed with many replicates, 53 independent viral lineages were selected with mutations observed at 23 different residues of the enzyme. Nevertheless, several common mutational pathways to nirmatrelvir resistance were preferred, with a majority of the viruses descending from T21I, P252L or T304I as precursor mutations. Construction and analysis of 13 recombinant {SARS}-{CoV}-2 clones showed that these mutations mediated only low-level resistance, whereas greater resistance required accumulation of additional mutations. E166V mutation conferred the strongest resistance (around 100-fold), but this mutation resulted in a loss of viral replicative fitness that was restored by compensatory changes such as L50F and T21I. Our findings indicate that {SARS}-{CoV}-2 resistance to nirmatrelvir does readily arise via multiple pathways in vitro, and the specific mutations observed herein form a strong foundation from which to study the mechanism of resistance in detail and to inform the design of next-generation protease inhibitors.},

	abstract = {The emergence of resistance to antiviral drugs increasingly used to treat {SARS}-{CoV}-2 infections has been recognised as a significant threat to {COVID}-19 control. In addition, some {SARS}-{CoV}-2 variants of concern appear to be intrinsically resistant to several classes of these antiviral agents. Therefore, there is a critical need for rapid recognition of clinically relevant polymorphisms in {SARS}-{CoV}-2 genomes associated with significant reduction of drug activity in virus neutralisation experiments. Here we present {SABRes}, a bioinformatic tool, which leverages on expanding public datasets of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 genomes and allows detection of drug resistance mutations in consensus genomes as well as in viral subpopulations. We have applied {SABRes} to detect resistance-conferring mutations in 25,197 genomes generated over the course of the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 pandemic in Australia and identified 299 genomes containing resistance conferring mutations to the five antiviral therapeutics that retain effectiveness against currently circulating strains of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 – Sotrovimab, Bebtelovimab, Remdesivir, Nirmatrelvir and Molnupiravir. These genomes accounted for a 1.18\% prevalence of resistant isolates discovered by {SABRes}, including 80 genomes with resistance conferring mutations found in viral subpopulations. Timely recognition of these mutations within subpopulations is critical as these mutations can provide an advantage under selective pressure and presents an important step forward in our ability to monitor {SARS}-{CoV}-2 drug resistance.},
